"""Maintenance tasks — retention cleanup.

The uploaded `cleanup_old_activity` could never run: no beat entry, no caller (D-15), and
its cutoff used `datetime.utcnow()` (naive, deprecated in 3.12) against a `timestamptz`
column while deleting every matching row in one unbounded transaction.

Here: a timezone-aware cutoff adapted to the active dialect, deletes in chunks of
`settings.activity_bulk_flush` so a first run against a large table cannot hold one long
transaction (long transactions block vacuum — lane 06 §4.4), and the number of deleted rows
is reported in the task result and in the log.
